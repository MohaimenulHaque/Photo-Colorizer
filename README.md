# Motivation
When I learned linear algebra and came to know about how the machine inteprets pictures as tensors and concept of image segmentation. I remember there were some movies which was restored and picutured in theatre. I just came across Research papers of University of california in image colorization. And most iimportantly when I colorized photos of my Grandmother with gorgeous saree, that smile in my mother's face worth it.
